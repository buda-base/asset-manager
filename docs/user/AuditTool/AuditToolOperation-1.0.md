# Audit Tool 1.0 Operation
## Installation and Configuration
Please refer to [Installation](./Install-1.0.md) for details of installation.

## Operation
### Starting

If `audit-tool` is not on your path, add its installation directory (this example is for MacOS running `zsh`)

```
export path=(/Applications/audit-tool.app/Contents/MacOS $path)
```

Running:

```
‚ùØ audit-tool
usage: audit-tool [options] { - | Directory,Directory,Directory}
where:

                 - read folders from standard input

                 Directory .... is a list of directories separated by
                 whitespace
[options] are:
-d,--debug             Show debugging information
-i,--inputFile <arg>   Input file, one path per line
-l,--log_home <arg>    Test Result log directory. Must be writable.
                       Default is <UserHome>/audit-test-logs/. Created if
                       not exists
```


The `-d` switch has no functionality as of release 1.0
### Exit status
Release `V09. Rel 4` (6 Nov 2020) adds 'WARNING' semantics to test outcomes. Several tests require the existence of well-known directory names which contain image groups. You can set these names in the `shell.properties` files on a site-by-site basis.
With this release, if those directories aren't found, the test will hold the "Not run" outcome, and the logs will log the tests results as a WARN, instead of an Error.
The overall result of a batch of tests has new semantics as well. Formerly, a test run passed only if all tests passed. A WARNING result would have been determined to be the same as an ERROR. In this release, the overall run result is calculated:
- PASS only if every test passed
- WARN if some tests passed and some tests had WARN status
- FAIL if any test failed.
This result is captured in the output file name of the run result: `{PASS|WARN|FAIL}-WorkRID={date}.csv`

However, the return code of the audittool program is still
- 0 if no tests failed (some may have passed, some may have warned)
- 1 if any test failed
### Using input files
The Java runtime in audit tool expects to find its input files (the -i flag, and the - flag) and arguments in the UTF-8 encoding. This is native on
most of audit tool's supported platforms. Using redirection (the `>` or `|` operators)on Microsoft Windows Powershell  
**may not** create files with the correct encoding. Powershell's pipe operator doesn't behave like
Linux, so piping a output of a file to audit tool may not behave as expected.

Correcting the encoding is outside of the scope of this document. For best results, do all pipe and file manipulation
inside the `cmd` environment, or upgrade to PowerShell 6.
### Outputs

#### Run logs and work logs
Audit tool creates two sets of logs:
- Run logs, which capture one invocation of Audit tool. These are in _\<User home\>_/audit-tool-logs/. Two sets,
csv, and log files are generated. _\<User home\>_ is the interactive user's home directory.
- Per Work logs. One .CSV file is created for each work audittool scans. A "work" in this context means a top level directory.
It is not connected to any existing BDRC library. These are located in either the Run log home (above) or in the directory
specified in the `-l | --log_home` argument.

Note to windows users: You can change the default log home in the `log4j2.properties` file in the installer.
That file contains a proposed Windows location.

#### Per work logs
##### File name

Each work which is analyzed has its output written to a file _WorkName.YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM_.csv in the work log location (se above.)
_YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM_ of course, stands for the run date and time.

Optionally, the user can indicate the pass or fail status of each work's test by setting properties
in the installation's `log4j2.propertes` file. This shows the properties:

```properties
property.passPrefix=PASS-
property.failPrefix=FAIL-
property.warnPrefix=WARN-

```

Any unicode text is allowed, but please bear in mind that support staff might not have the fonts
installed on their machines.

#### Work log contents
The work log file contains the results for each test in sequence. Tests which are ordinarily found in the detail
logs are added after the overall test result.

The work run log contains a blend of the summary and the detail loggers below, in `csv` format. A sample work log is:

|id|test_name|outcome|error_number|error_test|detail_path|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|W1KG13765|No Files in Root Folder|Passed| | |/Users/dev/tmp/pub/00/W1KG13765|
|W1KG13765|Web Image Attributes|Failed|/Users/dev/tmp/pub/00/W1KG13765| | |
| | | |110|Image file /Users/dev/tmp/pub/00/W1KG13765/images/W1KG13765-I1KG14951/I1KG149510049.tif has no suitable reader.|/Users/dev/tmp/pub/00/W1KG13765|

| | |105|Sequence File dimensions does not end in an integer: ends with  not found|/Users/dev/tmp/pub/00/W1KG13765

### Run logs
Audit Tool log outputs are in subdirectories of `audit-tool-logs` of the user's home directory. You can change the base
folder in two ways:
- edit in the Audit tool's `log4j2.properties` entry `property.logRoot` entry.
- use the `-l | --log_home` argument in the call to `audittool.sh`

You can configure other logging properties in the `log4j2.properties` file. **NOTE: log4j2 is significantly different from the original log4j.**

Under `audit-tool-logs` are folders containing **csv** and **log**

#### Log Contents

##### Log
|Level|File name|Details|
|----|----|----|
|Summary|`AuditTestShell-SUMMARY-date&Time.log`|Audit Tool writes a summary of each test to the console, and to a summary log file. The summary log file shows the pass/fail status of each test on each given directory.|
|Detail|`AuditTestShell-DETAIL-date&Time.log`|A detailed log file,  shows each file which failed a specific test.|
|Internal|`AuditTestShell-TestInt-date&time.log`| the shell passes in this log4j logger for test internal logging.|


The detail files contain the summary result. If there were failures, each item which failed is separately listed (see below)
##### CSV
CSV files are output for easier analysis and collection. They follow the log files' naming conventions.

Summary and detail log files have different data formats.
The summary file contains:

|outcome|path|test_name|
|---|---|---|
|Passed|\\\TBRCRS3\Archive\W1KG10190|No Files in Root Folder|

The detail file contains:

|error_number|error_test|path|
|---|---|---|
|104|Image group folder \\\TBRCRS3\Archive\W1KG10190\archive\W1KG10190-I1KG10192  fails files only test.|\\\TBRCRS3\Archive\W1KG10190|
|103|Image group folder \\\TBRCRS3\Archive\W1KG10190\archive\W1KG10190-I1KG10192  contains directory S0001491.JOB-A|\\\TBRCRS3\Archive\W1KG10190|

Note that the path which failed the test is given as a separate data element: there is  no obligation that the error message contain the path,
and separating the path allows for easier data access.


## Principles of operation
Audit tool's initial release runs every test in the test library tests against a complete work. There is no provision yet for running a test against a single image group or  subdirectory of a work.
### Property file

`shell.properties`

Audit tool reads several variables from its property file `shell.properties` which is found in the same subdirectory as the shell jar file. These properties locate the tests and define parameters which the tests need, such as the
folder names of parents of image groups.

`log4j2.properties`

Values relating to logging and output appear here. You can configure the parent folder of log files, their formats and file names.

## Overriding properties

+ As a user, you can override `shell.properties` properties by creating a file `$HOME/.config/bdrc/auditTool/user.properties`
+ As a system administrator, you can override any property (even user properties) by defining them in the `[JavaOptions`options
section of `INSTALL_DIR/app/audit-tool.cfg` file. (where `INSTALL_DIR` is the location where the system installed Audit tool )
See [Audit Tool Install 1.0 Guide](./Install-1.0.md)

In this example, we're overriding the MaximumImageFileSize property to a value slightly smaller than the default.
```
....
[JavaOptions]
....
java-options=-DMaximumImageFileSize=300k
...
```

**Note** the evaluation is one-pass. You cannot override the
default user.properties file on the command line. This will not cause the
values of 'other_config.properties' to be read in. Command line
properties are always read last.

Detailed examples are given in Appendix I.

### Test output
The tests themselves do not output results. The test framework allows the shell to iterate over the results and act on them.
Initially, these are sent to log files, but we could send them to a database without changing any code, by reconfiguring the logging
to send to a database.

You can toggle on and off logging by changing comment status as described in the `log4j2.properties` file.

### Test Internal logging
To trace tests' internal logs, each test gets passed in an internal logger whose name
 is its class name. The logger which handles these are in the `log4j2.properties` file in the section `logger.testLogger.name=io.bdrc.am.audit.audittests`
To reduce output, this logger's appender is set to null, as shown here:

```
# ---------------------      Test Internals logging  ---------------

appender.testInternals.name=testInternalsName
#
# To activate internal test logging, uncomment this line, and comment out
# the remaining testInternals lines
appender.testInternals.type=Null
# To activate internal test logging, comment the previous line, and uncomment the next stanza
# appender.testInternals.type=File
# appender.testInternals.append=false
# appender.testInternals.fileName=${logPrefix}-${TestInt}-${date:yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss}.log
# appender.testInternals.layoutString.type = PatternLayout
# appender.testInternals.layoutString.pattern=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH.mm.ss}   %-5p %m   :%C:%n
#
# --------------------- end  Test Internals logging ----------------

```


# Appendix I
## Property overriding example

In this example, we test a work overriding the `MaximumImageFileSize` property. This example shows
runs that use:
- the default property
- a much smaller value, defined in `user.properties`
- an override of that smaller value defined in the system parameters (for administrators only).

Ex 1. No `user.properties` file, `shell.properties` value of `400K` used. Tests pass
```shell
‚ùØ ls -l ~/.config/bdrc/auditTool/user.properties
gls: cannot access '/Users/XXX/.config/bdrc/auditTool/user.properties': No such file or directory
‚ùØ audittool.sh -l .   ../../Archive/W8LS68226
starting -l . ../../Archive/W8LS68226
INFO  Passed	/Users/jimk/dev/tmp/at/test/../../Archive/W8LS68226		Archive EXIF Test
INFO  Passed	/Users/jimk/dev/tmp/at/test/../../Archive/W8LS68226		No Files in Root Folder
INFO  Passed	/Users/jimk/dev/tmp/at/test/../../Archive/W8LS68226		Image EXIF Test
INFO  Passed	/Users/jimk/dev/tmp/at/test/../../Archive/W8LS68226		Web Image Attributes
INFO  Passed	/Users/jimk/dev/tmp/at/test/../../Archive/W8LS68226		No folders allowed in Image Group folders

INFO  Passed	/Users/jimk/dev/tmp/at/test/../../Archive/W8LS68226		File Size Test
```

Ex 2. Using User.properties
Here, the default is set to 40K, and the Image file size test fails.
```shell
‚ùØ grep MaximumImage ~/.config/bdrc/auditTool/user.properties
MaximumImageFileSize=40K
‚ùØ audittool.sh -l .   ../../Archive/W8LS68226
starting -l . ../../Archive/W8LS68226
INFO  Passed	/Users/jimk/dev/tmp/at/test/../../Archive/W8LS68226		Archive EXIF Test
INFO  Passed	/Users/jimk/dev/tmp/at/test/../../Archive/W8LS68226		No Files in Root Folder
INFO  Passed	/Users/jimk/dev/tmp/at/test/../../Archive/W8LS68226		Image EXIF Test
INFO  Passed	/Users/jimk/dev/tmp/at/test/../../Archive/W8LS68226		Web Image Attributes
INFO  Passed	/Users/jimk/dev/tmp/at/test/../../Archive/W8LS68226		No folders allowed in Image Group folders
INFO  Passed	/Users/jimk/dev/tmp/at/test/../../Archive/W8LS68226		File Sequence Test
ERROR Failed	/Users/jimk/dev/tmp/at/test/../../Archive/W8LS68226		File Size Test
Errors! returned:1: check logs
```

Ex 3: Raising the user properties value

```shell
‚ùØ grep MaximumImage ~/.config/bdrc/auditTool/user.properties
MaximumImageFileSize=300K
‚ùØ audittool.sh -l .   ../../Archive/W8LS68226
starting -l . ../../Archive/W8LS68226
INFO  Passed	/Users/jimk/dev/tmp/at/test/../../Archive/W8LS68226		Archive EXIF Test
INFO  Passed	/Users/jimk/dev/tmp/at/test/../../Archive/W8LS68226		No Files in Root Folder
INFO  Passed	/Users/jimk/dev/tmp/at/test/../../Archive/W8LS68226		Image EXIF Test
INFO  Passed	/Users/jimk/dev/tmp/at/test/../../Archive/W8LS68226		Web Image Attributes
INFO  Passed	/Users/jimk/dev/tmp/at/test/../../Archive/W8LS68226		No folders allowed in Image Group folders
INFO  Passed	/Users/jimk/dev/tmp/at/test/../../Archive/W8LS68226		File Sequence Test
INFO  Passed	/Users/jimk/dev/tmp/at/test/../../Archive/W8LS68226		File Size Test
```
Ex 4: Overriding user.properties with VM arguments

In this example, we've defined a much smaller argument in `INSTALL_DIR/app/audit-tool.cfg`, and the test
fails.
```shell
‚ùØ grep Maximum /opt/audit-tool/app/audit-tool.cfg
java-option=-DMaximumImageFileSize=30K

‚ùØ ./use_vm_args_to_override.sh -l .   ../../Archive/W8LS68226

# Updates
Date|Notes
---|---
4 Nov 2020| Add Warning semantics. For some tests, if a required directory does not exist, the test should not fail. </br>(For example, the `ImageSizeTest` test requires the folder `image` to exist.</br>If it does not, the test cannot be said to fail, since it was never run.
 &nbsp;| Cases where this occurs generate a test result of WARN.</br>Files which would have been renamed PASS or FAIL </br>are now renamed WARN--... in the case when some tests succeeded and some had warnings.
 &nbsp;| The return code of `audittool` also accommodates this extension. If any test failed outright,</br> the return code from `audittool` is 1. If all tests succeeded,</br> or some tests succeeded, while some generated warnings,</br> `audittool` returns 0 (as if all tests succeeded)  
 2021-05-14|Add overrides of properties
26 Jan 2022|Added platform install changes to configuration.
&nbsp;|Removed external test and test development - Still in 0.9 Operation
