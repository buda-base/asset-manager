# Audit Tool 1.0 Operation
## Installation and Configuration
Please refer to [Installation](Install-1.0.md) for details of installation.

## Starting Audit Tool
Start the audit tool with the `audit-tool` command. Release 1.0 does not require the configuration that 0.9 did.
The arguments to audit tool are simply:
```psv
‚ùØ audit-tool -h
usage: audit-tool [options] { - | PathToWork PathToWork ..... }
where:

                  - read Paths To Works from standard input

                  PathToWork ... is a list of directories separated by
                  whitespace
[options] are:
 -d,--debug             Show debugging information
 -D,--Define <Define>   -D property=value:property2=value2:... or -D
                        property=value -D property2=value2 ...
 -h,--help              Usage
 -i,--inputFile <arg>   Input file, one Path to Work per line
 -l,--log_home <arg>    Test Result log directory. Must be writable.
                        Default is <UserHome>/audit-test-logs/. Created if
                        not exists
 -v,--version           Shows internal development version (resources)
```

The `-d` switch has no functionality as of release 1.0
## Exit status
Release `V09. Rel 4` (6 Nov 2020) adds 'WARNING' semantics to test outcomes. Several tests require the existence of well-known directory names which contain image groups. You can set these names in the `shell.properties` files on a site-by-site basis.
With this release, if those directories aren't found, the test will hold the "Not run" outcome, and the logs will log the tests results as a WARN, instead of an Error.
The overall result of a batch of tests has new semantics as well. Formerly, a test run passed only if all tests passed. A WARNING result would have been determined to be the same as an ERROR. In this release, the overall run result is calculated:
- PASS only if every test passed
- WARN if some tests passed and some tests had WARN status
- FAIL if any test failed.
This result is captured in the output file name of the run result: `{PASS|WARN|FAIL}-WorkRID={date}.csv`

However, the return code of the audittool program is still
- 0 if no tests failed (some may have passed, some may have warned)
- 1 if any test failed

## Input

### Using input files
The Java runtime in audit tool expects to find its input files (the -i flag, and the - flag) and arguments in the UTF-8 encoding. This is native on
most of audit tool's supported platforms. Using redirection (the `>` or `|` operators)on Microsoft Windows Powershell  
**may not** create files with the correct encoding. Powershell's pipe operator doesn't behave like
Linux, so piping a output of a file to audit tool may not behave as expected.

Correcting the encoding is outside of the scope of this document. For best results, do all pipe and file manipulation
inside the `cmd` environment, or upgrade to PowerShell 6.

### Using Standard Input
`_tbd_@Tseng:~$ audit-tool -` will read a pathname from standard input. You can pipe input to audit tool this way.

## Input inputFile
Given a file `shortWorks` which contains a list of paths to works,
 ```
/Users/_tbd_/mnt/Archive/W0FFY001
/Users/_tbd_/mnt/Archive/W0FFY002
/Users/_tbd_/mnt/Archive/W0FFY003
```

running `_tbd_@Tseng:iaAudit$ audit-tool -i shortWorks`
will execute the tests on each folder in turn.


### Pathname as argument
to just pass paths to audit-tool on the command line, just invoke with the paths separated by commas:

```bash
_tbd_@Tseng:iaAudit$ audit-tool /Users/_tbd_/mnt/Archive/W0FFY001,/Users/_tbd_/mnt/Archive/W0FFY002,/Users/_tbd_/mnt/Archive/W0FFY003
```


### Audit tool tests
Tests are found in a named library which the `audit-tool` script passes to the `auditool` main jar file.
The initial set of tests is specified in [Image capture Test Requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TrjUdoLJd5N90d1vWloRqNrlC144-DPfLrClOLsbhVg/edit?usp=sharing)

##Output

### Run logs and work logs
Audit tool creates two sets of logs:
- Run logs, which capture one invocation of Audit tool. These are in _\<User home\>_/audit-tool-logs/. Two sets,
csv, and log files are generated. _\<User home\>_ is the interactive user's home directory.
- Per Work logs. One .CSV file is created for each work audittool scans. A "work" in this context means a top level directory.
It is not connected to any existing BDRC library. These are located in either the Run log home (above) or in the directory
specified in the `-l | --log_home` argument.

Note to windows users: You can change the default log home in the `log4j2.properties` file in the installer.
That file contains a proposed Windows location.

### Per work logs
#### File name

Each work which is analyzed has its output written to a file _WorkName.YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM_.csv in the work log location (se above.)
_YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM_ of course, stands for the run date and time.

Optionally, the user can indicate the pass or fail status of each work's test by setting properties
in the installation's `log4j2.propertes` file. This shows the properties:

```properties
property.passPrefix=PASS-
property.failPrefix=FAIL-
property.warnPrefix=WARN-

```

Any unicode text is allowed, but please bear in mind that support staff might not have the fonts
installed on their machines.

#### Work log contents
The work log file contains the results for each test in sequence. Tests which are ordinarily found in the detail
logs are added after the overall test result.

The work run log contains a blend of the summary and the detail loggers below, in `csv` format. A sample work log is:
Note the detail record starts with three empty fields, 
```shell
id,test_name,outcome,error_number,error_test,detail_path

### Run logs
By default, Audit Tool log outputs are in subdirectories of `audit-tool-logs` of the user's home directory. You can change the base
folder in two ways:
- edit in the Audit tool's `log4j2.properties` entry `property.logRoot` entry.
- use the `-l | --log_home` argument in the call to `audit-tool` This overrides the `log4j2.properties` value.

You can configure other logging properties in the `log4j2.properties` file. **NOTE: log4j2 is significantly different from the original log4j.**

Under `~/audit-tool-logs` or the `-log_home` folder are folders containing **csv** and **log**

#### Log Contents

##### Log
|Level|File name|Details|
|----|----|----|
|Summary|`AuditTestShell-SUMMARY-date&Time.log`|Audit Tool writes a summary of each test to the console, and to a summary log file. The summary log file shows the pass/fail status of each test on each given directory.|
|Detail|`AuditTestShell-DETAIL-date&Time.log`|A detailed log file,  shows each file which failed a specific test.|
|Internal|`AuditTestShell-TestInt-date&time.log`| the shell passes in this log4j logger for test internal logging.|


The detail files contain the summary result. If there were failures, each item which failed is separately listed (see below)
##### CSV
CSV files are output for easier analysis and collection. They follow the log files' naming conventions.

Summary and detail log files have different data formats.
The summary file contains:

|outcome|path|test_name|
|---|---|---|
|Passed|\\\TBRCRS3\Archive\W1KG10190|No Files in Root Folder|

The detail file contains:

|error_number|error_test|path|
|---|---|---|
|104|Image group folder \\\TBRCRS3\Archive\W1KG10190\archive\W1KG10190-I1KG10192  fails files only test.|\\\TBRCRS3\Archive\W1KG10190|
|103|Image group folder \\\TBRCRS3\Archive\W1KG10190\archive\W1KG10190-I1KG10192  contains directory S0001491.JOB-A|\\\TBRCRS3\Archive\W1KG10190|

Note that the path which failed the test is given as a separate data element: there is  no obligation that the error message contain the path,
and separating the path allows for easier data access.

### Tracing and diagnostic logs
Audit tool creates a file, in the log directory's root, that blends the console output and diagnostic output.
(See the `-l` flag) See [Tracing and Diagnostic Options](#tracing-and-diagnostic-options) for allowed values. The diagnostics
are intended primarily to show the runtime environment more than the internal processing.

#### Tracing and Diagnostic Options
Use the -D (-Define) command flag to define diagnostic options at run time. Arguments specified by the `-D` flag take the form:
`-D key=value` You can use either the form `-D key=value -D key1=value1 ...` 
or `-D key=value:key2=value2....`or both.    The **keys** which AuditTool recognizes are:

| Key                | allowed values         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Diagnostics        | params,properties, jvm | params:Prints the command line.<br/>properties:Prints all the properties that Audit Tool uses, along with their definition location (`shell.properties`, `user.properties` or command line)<br/> JVM: Prints all system properties and JVM options. |
| DiagnosticFileName | valid file path        | Location of the diagnostic console. If the directory is not an absolute path, it is relative to the value of the log default directory (the `-log_home` value or the default, `~/audit/-test-logs`)                                                 |
| AppendDiagnostic   | true,false             | If the file given in the `AppendDiagnostic` exists, append to it, otherwise overwrite it.                                                                                                                                                           |

## Principles of operation
Audit tool's initial release runs every test in the test library tests against a complete work. There is no provision yet for running a test against a single image group or  subdirectory of a work.

## Configuration
### Property file

`shell.properties`

Audit tool reads several variables from its property file `shell.properties` which is found in the same subdirectory as the shell jar file. These properties locate the tests and define parameters which the tests need, such as the
folder names of parents of image groups.

`log4j2.properties`

Values relating to logging and output appear here. You can configure the parent folder of log files, their formats and file names.

### Overriding properties

+ As a user, you can override `shell.properties` properties by creating a file `$HOME/.config/bdrc/auditTool/user.properties`
+ As a system administrator, you can override any property (even user properties) by defining them in the `[JavaOptions]`
section of the `app/audit-tool.config` file.

In this example, we're overriding the MaximumImageFileSize property to a value slightly smaller than the default. (this is not a recommended procedure.
Since the Java environment is read first, any value in the `shell.properties` or `user.properties` file will override it)
```
[JavaOptions]
java-options=-Djpackage.app-version=1.0
java-options=-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8
java-options=-Xms256m
java-options=-DMaximumImageFileSize=300K
```

**v1.0 Beta Note** The v1.0Beta-2022-04-25 version of audit tool introduced the -D (-Define) command line option. This
allows users to define or override any option that is found in the profiles (shell.profile and user.profile). It also allows
the user to specify an alternate profile to the standard user profile, by overriding the `UserConfigPath` value:

```shell
audit-tool ..... -D UserConfigPath=special/override
```

this will cause the file `$HOME/special/override` to be read in place of the standard user profile.
Note that other variables defined on the command line will override values in the alternate profile.
For example, if the file `$HOME/special/override` contains: `MaximumImageFileSize=100K` but the command:


```shell
audit-tool ..... -D UserConfigPath=special/override -D MaximumImageFileSize=300K
```

is given, the effective maximum image file size is 300K, as given in the command line.

~~**Note** the evaluation is one-pass. You cannot override the
default user.properties file on the command line. This will not cause the
values of 'other_config.properties' to be read in. Command line
properties are always read last.~~


Detailed examples are given in Appendix I.

### Overriding test errors
The user can override any error they wish (while still remaining mindful that some errors
must be fixed when submitting works to BDRC or its partners). You do this by adding
numeric values to `shell.properties ErrorsAsWarning` property.
Please refer to the installation's `shell.properties` for the appropriate values.

If a test **only** fails on a test whose number is in the ErrorsAsWarning List, the test result outcome will be set to WARN.
Note that any test can have multiple failures - each failure is independent of the others. See especially the ImageAttribute tests


### Test Requirements
The test requirements and functions are outside the scope of this document. A draft requirements document of the tests
can be found at [Audit Tool Test Requirements](https://buda-base.github.io/asset-manager/req/tests/)

<!--  jimk : not needed now
### Operation
The Audit Tool shell jar (which `audit-tool` passes as the main jar file to java) can either run an internal set of tests,
or can use an external jar file.  It runs all the tests in the library against all the directories given in the arguments.

Please refer to [Using an external library](#Using-an-external-test-library) for instructions on how to use an external test library.
--> 

### Test output and format
The tests themselves do not output results. The test framework allows the shell to iterate over the results and act on them.
Initially, these are sent to log files, but we could send them to a database without changing any code, by reconfiguring the logging
to send to a database.

audit-tool uses the `log4j` platform to control its logging. The user can review the `log4j2.properties` file in `$APPDIR`

### Test Internal logging
To trace tests' internal logs, each test gets passed in an internal logger whose name
 is its class name. The logger which handles these are in the `log4j2.properties` file in the section `logger.testLogger.name=io.bdrc.am.audit.audittests`
To reduce output, this logger's appender is set to null, as shown here:

```
# ---------------------      Test Internals logging  ---------------

appender.testInternals.name=testInternalsName
#
# To activate internal test logging, uncomment this line, and comment out
# the remaining testInternals lines
appender.testInternals.type=Null
# To activate internal test logging, comment the previous line, and uncomment the next stanza
# appender.testInternals.type=File
# appender.testInternals.append=false
# appender.testInternals.fileName=${logPrefix}-${TestInt}-${date:yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss}.log
# appender.testInternals.layoutString.type = PatternLayout
# appender.testInternals.layoutString.pattern=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH.mm.ss}   %-5p %m   :%C:%n
#
# --------------------- end  Test Internals logging ----------------

```

<!-- jimk - not supported yet
### Using an external test library
Audit tool contains an internal library which contains various tests. To run a different library, you need to define two
JVM options with the `-D` flag:
- testJar:  Path to the Jar file which contains the tests
- testDictionaryClassName: the fully qualified variable name of a public class in the `testJar` which implements
`io.bdrc.audit.ITestDictionary`

Example:


```
[JavaOptions]
java-options=-Djpackage.app-version=1.0
java-options=-Dfile.encoding=UTF-8
java-options=-Xms256m
java-options=-DtestJar=/usr/local/bin/at09/audit-test-lib-someversion.jar
java-options=-DtestDictionaryClassName=io.bdrc.am.at.audittests.TestDictionary
```

# Appendix I
## Property overriding example

In this example, we test a work overriding the `MaximumImageFileSize` property. This example shows
runs that use:
- the default property
- a much smaller value, defined in `user.properties`
- an override of that smaller value defined in the shell script.

### Ex 1: No overrides 
No `user.properties` file, `shell.properties` value of `400K` used. Tests pass

```shell
‚ùØ ls -l ~/.config/bdrc/auditTool/user.properties
gls: cannot access '/Users/XXX/.config/bdrc/auditTool/user.properties': No such file or directory

#Ex 5: Overriding user properties location
Create a file with a MaximumImageFileSize:
```shell
‚ùØ cat tmp.properties
MaximumImageFileSize=22K
```
And reference it on the command line, with the key `UserConfigPath` 
the value of `UserConfigPath` must either be an absolute path, or be with respect to the user's $HOME directory)

```shell
‚ùØ audit-tool -l . -D UserConfigPath=dev/tmp/tmp.properties  Archive/W8LS68226
INFO  Passed    /Users/jimk/dev/tmp/Archive/W8LS68226           Image file name format test

INFO  Passed    /Users/jimk/dev/tmp/Archive/W8LS68226           Image EXIF Thumbnail Test
```
We see that the the test fails the "File Size Test", and that the value that was tested was the value in the `tmp.properties` file (22K = 22528)

```shell
‚ùØ cat FAIL-W8LS68226-2022-04-27-16-41.csv

```

## Ex 5: Overriding the overridden config path
For completeness, override the user properties. and override a property in it. In this case, first alter the `tmp.properties` file
In this properties file, we've set the threshold to 22K, but changed the error to be only a warning.
```shell
‚ùØ cat tmp.properties
MaximumImageFileSize=22K
ErrorsAsWarning=112
```

And in this command line, we've overridden the threshold in the `tmp.properties` on the command line. 

```shell
‚ùØ audit-tool -l . -D UserConfigPath=dev/tmp/tmp.properties -D MaximumImageFileSize=25K  Archive/W8LS68226
INFO  Passed    /Users/jimk/dev/tmp/Archive/W8LS68226           Image file name format test

INFO  Passed    /Users/jimk/dev/tmp/Archive/W8LS68226           Image EXIF Thumbnail Test
```
we see the test has only generated Warnings, and the size in the log file is 25K=25600:

```shell
‚ùØ cat WARN-W8LS68226-2022-04-27-16-51.csv

## Test Developer's Guide
This section describes how to implement and package different test libraries. The general Audit Tool User doesn't need
this material.
### Locating the tests
#### Test Dictionary
The shell assumes that the package `io.bdrc.am.audit.iaudit` is either:
- in the shell jar file itself
- on the class path
- or specified with the `-DtestJar .... -DtestDictionaryClassName` (see 'Using an external test library' above)

#### Test Config objects

The test dictionary has a dependency on AuditTestConfig class. Test developers include this library
in their Jar, and provide Test configuration objects. The test configuration objects provide information to the shell as
to a test's name, friendly description, class which implements the test (which, again, can be in any package in the library)
.

![AuditTestConfig](images/AuditTestConfig.png)

#### `AuditTestConfig` constructor
```
 /**
     * Instantiates a new Audit test config.
     *
     * @param fullName  the full name
     * @param argNames  the arg names
     * @param shortName the short name
     * @param clazz     the clazz
     */
    public AuditTestConfig(String fullName, List<String> argNames, String shortName, Class<?> clazz)
```
To package a test you implement one of these and add it to your TestDictionary.

`audit-test-lib.TestDictionary()` constructor shows `AuditTestConfig` usaqe:

```
 private final Hashtable<String, AuditTestConfig> _TestDictionary = new Hashtable<String, AuditTestConfig>() {
        {
            put("FileSequence", new AuditTestConfig("File Sequence Test",

                    // This statement asserts that the caller has to provide values for these
                    // arguments
                    Arrays.asList(
                            "ArchiveImageGroupParent", "DerivedImageGroupParent"),
                    "FileSequence", FileSequence.class));

            //noinspection ArraysAsListWithZeroOrOneArgument
            put("NoFilesInFolder", new AuditTestConfig("No Files in Root Folder",
                    Arrays.asList(""),
                    "NoFilesInFolder",
                    NoFilesInRoot.class));

            put("NoFoldersInImageGroups", new AuditTestConfig("No folders allowed in Image Group folders",
                    Arrays.asList("ArchiveImageGroupParent", "DerivedImageGroupParent"),"NoFoldersInImageGroups",
                    NoFoldersInImageGroups.class));
        }
    };
```
##### Parameters
The constructor takes these parameters

| name      | type           | description                                                                                                                                               |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| fullName  | `String`       | Free form text                                                                                                                                            |
| argNames  | `List<String>` | List of argument names. The caller of the test provides a List of Strings which are K=V pairs. This is a poor man's implementation of Python's `**kwargs` |
| shortName | `String`       | Short mnemonic, for use in scripting. Should not contain spaces. Usually, this is the TestDictionary. key for which this object is the value              |
| clazz     | `Class<?>`     | Any class object which implements the `IAuditTest` interface.                                                                                             |

#### Running a test
A full production instance is available in `audit-test-shell/src/main/java/io/bdrc/am/audit/shell/shell.java`

Once you've acquired its `AuditTestConfig` object, the components of running a test are:
- Instantiating its with its constructor
- setting its path and keyword arguments (`IAudit.setParams()`)
- calling it's `LaunchTest` implementation.

This code fragment of `audit-test-shell` shows this operation
```
          Constructor<IAuditTest> ctor = testClass.getConstructor(Logger.class);
            IAuditTest inst = ctor.newInstance(testLogger);

            inst.setParams((Object[]) params);
            inst.LaunchTest();

            tr = inst.getTestResult();
```
(you can implement your test classes without a Constructor requiring a logger. In this case, the test writer and the shell writer conspired together to require a logger in the constructor.)

#### Examining test results.
`audit-test-interface/io/bdrc/am/audit/iaudit/TestResult` and `TestMessage` define the objects which implement test results.

The `TestResult.Passed()` method contains the overall outcome of the test.
Test messages are retrieved by the `TestResults.getErrors()` method. It's a good idea to have the first error in the list name the container which failed the test, followed by all the specific failure instances for each file. The caller determines the logging disposition.

| 25 Apr 2022 | Integrated Jan 2021 packaging, and 18 April v1.0_beta1 features |
| 4 Nov 2020 | Add Warning semantics. For some tests, if a required directory does not exist, the test should not fail. (For example, the `ImageSizeTest` test requires the folder `image` to exist.If it does not, the test cannot be said to fail, since it was never run.          |
| &nbsp;     | Cases where this occurs generate a test result of WARN. Files which would have been renamed PASS or FAIL are now renamed WARN--... in the case when some tests succeeded and some had warnings.                                                                        |
| &nbsp;     | The return code of `audittool` also accommodates this extension. If any test failed outright, the return code from `audittool` is 1. If all tests succeeded, or some tests succeeded, while some generated warnings, `audittool` returns 0 (as if all tests succeeded) |
