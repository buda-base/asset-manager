# Audit Tool Operation
## Installation and Configuration
Please refer to [Installation](Install.md) for details of installation.
## Operation
On Windows machines, the script type `.sh` is replaced with PowerShell scripts, which have the suffix `.ps1`
### Starting
Start the audit tool with the `audittool.sh` script. The configuration step above should have initialized  locations of the software which `audittool.sh` needs.
The arguments to audit tool are simply:
```psv
usage: AuditTest [options] { - | Directory,Directory,Directory}
where:

                 - read folders from standard input

                 Directory,.... is a list of directories separated by ,
[options] are:
 -d,--debug             Show debugging information
 -i,--inputFile <arg>   Input file, one path per line
 -l,--log_home <arg>    Test Result log directory. Must be writable.
                        Default is <UserHome>/audit-test-logs/. Created if
                        not exists. Other logs are still written to default log home
```

The `-d` switch has no functionality as of release 0.9

## Using input files
The Java runtime in audit tool expects to find its input files (the -i flag, and the - flag) and arguments in the UTF-8 encoding. This is native on
most of audit tool's supported platforms. Using redirection (the `>` or `|` operators)on Microsoft Windows Powershell  
**may not** create files with the correct encoding.

Correcting the encoding is outside of the scope of this document. For best results, do all pipe and file manipulation 
inside the `cmd` environment, or upgrade to PowerShell 6.
### Outputs

#### Run logs and work logs
Audit tool creates two sets of logs:
- Run logs, which capture one invocation of Audit tool. These are in _<User home>_/audit-tool-logs/. Two sets, 
csv, and log files are generated.
- Per Work logs. One .CSV file is created for each work audittool scans. A "work" in this context means a top level directory.
It is not connected to any existing BDRC library. These are located in either the Run log home (above) or in the directory
specified in the `-l | --log_home` argument.

Note to windows users: You can change the default log home in the `log4j2.properties` file in the installer.
That file contains a proposed Windows location.

#### Per work logs
Each work which is analyzed has its output written to a file _WorkName.YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM_.csv in the work log location (se above.)
_YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM_ of course, stands for the run date and time.

The work log file contains the results for each test in sequence. Tests which are ordinarily found in the detail
logs are added after the overall test result.

The work run log contains a blend of the summary and the detail loggers below. A sample work log is:

|id|test_name|outcome|error_number|error_test|detail_path|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|W1KG13765|No Files in Root Folder|Passed| | |/Users/dev/tmp/pub/00/W1KG13765|
|W1KG13765|Web Image Attributes|Failed|/Users/dev/tmp/pub/00/W1KG13765| | |
| | | |110|Image file /Users/dev/tmp/pub/00/W1KG13765/images/W1KG13765-I1KG14951/I1KG149510049.tif has no suitable reader.|/Users/dev/tmp/pub/00/W1KG13765|

| | |105|Sequence File dimensions does not end in an integer: ends with  not found|/Users/dev/tmp/pub/00/W1KG13765

#### Run logs
Audit Tool log outputs are in subdirectories of `audit-tool-logs` of the user's home directory. You can change the base
folder in two ways:
- edit in the Audit tool's `log4j2.properties` entry `property.logRoot` entry.
- use the `-l | --log_home` argument in the call to `audittool.sh` 

You can configure other logging properties in the `log4j2.properties` file. **NOTE: log4j2 is significantly different from the original log4j.**

Under `audit-tool-logs` are folders containing **csv** and **log**

### Log Contents

##### Log
|Level|File name|Details|
|----|----|----|
|Summary|`AuditTestShell-SUMMARY-date&Time.log`|Audit Tool writes a summary of each test to the console, and to a summary log file. The summary log file shows the pass/fail status of each test on each given directory.|
|Detail|`AuditTestShell-DETAIL-date&Time.log`|A detailed log file,  shows each file which failed a specific test.|
|Internal|`AuditTestShell-TestInt-date&time.log`| the shell passes in this log4j logger for test internal logging.|


The detail files contain the summary result. If there were failures, each item which failed is separately listed (see below)
##### CSV
CSV files are output for easier analysis and collection. They follow the log files' naming conventions.

Summary and detail log files have different data formats.
The summary file contains:

|outcome|path|test_name|
|---|---|---|
|Passed|\\\TBRCRS3\Archive\W1KG10190|No Files in Root Folder|

The detail file contains:

|error_number|error_test|path|
|---|---|---|
|104|Image group folder \\\TBRCRS3\Archive\W1KG10190\archive\W1KG10190-I1KG10192  fails files only test.|\\\TBRCRS3\Archive\W1KG10190|
|103|Image group folder \\\TBRCRS3\Archive\W1KG10190\archive\W1KG10190-I1KG10192  contains directory S0001491.JOB-A|\\\TBRCRS3\Archive\W1KG10190|

Note that the path which failed the test is given as a separate data element: there is  no obligation that the error message contain the path,
and separating the path allows for easier data access.


## Principles of operation
Audit tool's initial release runs every test in the test library tests against a complete work. There is no provision yet for running a test against a single image group or  subdirectory of a work.
### Property file
Audit tool reads several variables from its property file `shell.properties.` These properties define parameters which the tests need, such as the
folder names of parents of image groups. `shell.properties` is expected to be found in the same directory as the audit-tool main jar file.

The test requirements and functions are outside of the scope of this document. A draft requirements document of the tests
can be found at [Audit Tool Test Requirements](https://buda-base.github.io/asset-manager/req/tests/)
### Operation
The Audit Tool shell jar (which `audittool.sh` passes as the main jar file to java) can either run an internal set of tests,
or can use an external jar file.  It runs all the tests in the library against all the directories given in the arguments.

Please refer to [Using an external library](#Using-an-external-test-library) for instructions on how to use an external test library.
### Test output
The tests themselves do not output results. The test framework allows the shell to iterate over the results and act on them.
Initially, these are sent to log files, but we could send them to a database without changing any code, by reconfiguring the logging
to send to a database.

### Test Internal logging
To trace tests' internal logs, each test gets passed in an internal logger whose name
 is its class name. The logger which handles these are in the `log4j2.properties` file in the section `logger.testLogger.name=io.bdrc.am.audit.audittests`
To reduce output, this logger's appender is set to null, as shown here:

```
# ---------------------      Test Internals logging  ---------------

appender.testInternals.name=testInternalsName
#
# To activate internal test logging, uncomment this line, and comment out
# the remaining testInternals lines
appender.testInternals.type=Null
# To activate internal test logging, comment the previous line, and uncomment the next stanza
# appender.testInternals.type=File
# appender.testInternals.append=false
# appender.testInternals.fileName=${logPrefix}-${TestInt}-${date:yyyy-MM-dd-HH-mm-ss}.log
# appender.testInternals.layoutString.type = PatternLayout
# appender.testInternals.layoutString.pattern=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH.mm.ss}   %-5p %m   :%C:%n
#
# --------------------- end  Test Internals logging ----------------

```

### Using an external test library
Audit tool contains an internal library which contains various tests. To run a different library, you need to define two
JVM options with the `-D` flag:
- testJar:  Path to the Jar file which contains the tests
- testDictionaryClassName: the fully qualified variable name of a public class in the `testJar` which implements 
`io.bdrc.audit.ITestDictionary`

You can toggle on and off logging by changing comment status as described in the log4j2.properties.
## Test Developer's Guide
This section describes how to implement and package different test libraries. The general Audit Tool User doesn't need
this material.
### Locating the tests
#### Test Dictionary
The shell assumes that the package `io.bdrc.am.audit.iaudit` is either:
 - in the shell jar file itself
 - on the class path
 - or specified with the `-DtestJar .... -DtestDictionaryClassName` (see 'Using an external test library' above)

#### Test Config objects

The test dictionary has a dependency on io.bdrc.am.audit.iaudit.AuditTestConfig class. Test developers include this library
in their Jar, and provide Test configuration objects. The test configuration objects provide information to the shell as
to a test's name, friendly description, class which implements the test (which, again, can be in any package in the library)
.

![AuditTestConfig](.AuditToolOperation_images/AuditTestConfig.png)

#### `AuditTestConfig` constructor
```
 /**
     * Instantiates a new Audit test config.
     *
     * @param fullName  the full name
     * @param argNames  the arg names
     * @param shortName the short name
     * @param clazz     the clazz
     */
    public AuditTestConfig(String fullName, List<String> argNames, String shortName, Class<?> clazz)
```
To package a test you implement one of these and add it to your TestDictionary.

`audit-test-lib.TestDictionary()` constructor shows `AuditTestConfig` usaqe:

```
 private final Hashtable<String, AuditTestConfig> _TestDictionary = new Hashtable<String, AuditTestConfig>() {
        {
            put("FileSequence", new AuditTestConfig("File Sequence Test",

                    // This statement asserts that the caller has to provide values for these
                    // arguments
                    Arrays.asList(
                            "ArchiveImageGroupParent", "DerivedImageGroupParent"),
                    "FileSequence", FileSequence.class));

            //noinspection ArraysAsListWithZeroOrOneArgument
            put("NoFilesInFolder", new AuditTestConfig("No Files in Root Folder",
                    Arrays.asList(""),
                    "NoFilesInFolder",
                    NoFilesInRoot.class));

            put("NoFoldersInImageGroups", new AuditTestConfig("No folders allowed in Image Group folders",
                    Arrays.asList("ArchiveImageGroupParent", "DerivedImageGroupParent"),"NoFoldersInImageGroups",
                    NoFoldersInImageGroups.class));
        }
    };
```
##### Parameters
The constructor takes these parameters

name|type|description
----|----|----
fullName|`String`|Free form text
argNames|`List<String>`|List of argument names. The caller of the test provides a List of Strings which are K=V pairs. This is a poor man's implementation of Python's `**kwargs`
shortName|`String`|Short mnemonic, for use in scripting. Should not contain spaces. Usually, this is the TestDictionary. key for which this object is the value
clazz|`Class<?>`|Any class object which implements the `io.bdrc.am.audit.iaudit.IAuditTest` interface.

#### Running a test
A full production instance is available in `audit-test-shell/src/main/java/io/bdrc/am/audit/shell/shell.java`

Once you've acquired its `AuditTestConfig` object, the components of running a test are:
- Instantiating its with its constructor
- setting its path and keyword arguments (`IAudit.setParams()`)
- calling it's `LaunchTest` implementation.

This code fragment of `audit-test-shell` shows this operation
```
          Constructor<IAuditTest> ctor = testClass.getConstructor(Logger.class);
            IAuditTest inst = ctor.newInstance(testLogger);

            inst.setParams((Object[]) params);
            inst.LaunchTest();

            tr = inst.getTestResult();
```
(you can implement your test classes without a Constructor requiring a logger. In this case, the test writer and the shell writer conspired together to require a logger in the constructor.)

#### Examining test results.
`audit-test-interface/io/bdrc/am/audit/iaudit/TestResult` and `TestMessage` define the objects which implement test results.

The `TestResult.Passed()` method contains the overall outcome of the test.
Test messages are retrieved by the `TestResults.getErrors()` method. It's a good idea to have the first error in the list name the container which failed the test, followed by all the specific failure instances for each file. The caller determines the logging disposition.
