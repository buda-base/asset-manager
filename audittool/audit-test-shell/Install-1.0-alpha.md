#  Audit Tool Installation

## New In Version 1.0
Version 1.0 is built and packaged under the most current LTS (Long Term Support) version of Java, 17. It exploits a packaging utility which provides native installation packages on supported MacOS, Debian, and Windows 10 platforms. This provides:

- No requirement for pre-installed Java - Audit-tool provides its own JRE (Java Runtime Engine), at JRE 17.3
- No need to configure a new install.
- Much simpler configuration: shell and Powershell scripts are no longer required.
-

and drag 'audit-tool.app' to '/Applications'

### Debian installation

## Configuration
This section applies to all platforms.

`audit-tool` now uses the `app/` subfolder of its installation directory for all its configuration. This file is generated by the install process. Changes you make to it will be overwritten when the application is re-installed.

This configuration replaces the `AT_HOME` and `CONFIG_ATHOME` settings of prior releases. Users with write permission can simply edit the `app/` files:

File|Purpose
---|---
audit-tool.cfg  | Generated list of complete properties to launch the application. Changes to this list are unsupported  
shell.properties  | Parameters for tests (such as names of directories, limits and error overrides)
log4j2.properties  | Logging control

Detailed configuration is described in [AuditToolOperation-1.0-alpha.md](./AuditToolOperation-1.0-alpha.md)

## Guidelines for Updating an existing installation
Installation overwrites any prior installations.
It is advisable to save existing configurations in the `app/` folder of the install and **carefully* merge them into a new install.
